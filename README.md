Diabetes On set Detection Using Deep Learning And Grid Search Mechanism.
This Project uses Deep Learnig Working On Neural Network Model To Predict The Diabetes Or Any Symptoms Of Diabetes And Clasifies Them Into class 0 and 1. Where Class 1 Singnifies 'Prone To Diabetes' and Class 0 Signifies 'Not Prone To Diabetes'.This Prediction is based on the 7 Parameters Taken Under Consideration while Fetching The data.The Grid Search Mecahnism Is Found To Be Very Efficient Here And When Applied Gives A Very Promising Accuracy Percentage.
